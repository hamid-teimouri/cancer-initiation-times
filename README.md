Elucidating the correlations between cancer initiation times and lifetime cancer risks

Teimouri H, Kochugaeva MP, Kolomeisky AB. Scientific Reports. 2019;9(1):1â€“8

Using a first-passage analysis the probabilities for the cancer to appear and the times before it happens,
which are viewed as fixation probabilities and fixation times, respectively, are explicitly calculated. 
It is predicted that the slowest cancer initiation dynamics is observed for neutral mutations,
while it is fast for both advantageous and, surprisingly, disadvantageous mutations. 
The method is applied for estimating the cancer initiation times from experimentally available 
lifetime cancer risks for different types of cancer. It is found that the higher probability of the cancer 
to occur does not necessary lead to the faster times of starting the cancer.
